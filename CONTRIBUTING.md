## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
feat: add new token analysis metric
fix: resolve WebSocket connection timeout
docs: update API documentation
refactor: improve caching logic
test: add unit tests for trading module
chore: update dependencies
```

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict type checking
- Avoid `any` types
- Document complex types with comments
- Export types for public APIs

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface TokenAnalysis {
  address: string;
  price: number;
  volume24h: number;
  holders: number;
}

async function analyzeToken(address: string): Promise<TokenAnalysis> {
  // implementation
}

// ❌ Bad
async function analyzeToken(address: any): Promise<any> {
  // implementation
}
```

### Testing

- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Run tests before submitting PR

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

```
