- **30 days**: Fix deployed (for critical issues)

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow a 90-day disclosure timeline:

3. **Day 30**: Fix deployed to production
4. **Day 90**: Public disclosure (if not already patched)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Wallet Security

```bash
# ✅ DO: Use environment variables
export WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="your_key"

# ❌ DON'T: Hardcode keys
const privateKey = "abc123..."; // NEVER DO THIS
```

#### API Key Management

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Load from secure config
const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;

// ❌ DON'T: Commit to git
const apiKey = "sk-ant-..."; // NEVER COMMIT
```

#### Rate Limiting

```typescript
// Built-in protection
const tradingQueue = new Queue({
  limiter: {
    max: 1,
    duration: 5000 // 5 second cooldown
  }
});
```

### For Developers

#### Input Validation

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Validate and sanitize
function buyToken(address: string, amount: number) {
  if (!isValidSolanaAddress(address)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid address');
  }
  if (amount <= 0 || amount > MAX_AMOUNT) {
    throw new Error('Invalid amount');
  }
  // proceed with trade
}

// ❌ DON'T: Trust user input
function buyToken(address: any, amount: any) {
  // No validation - DANGEROUS
}
```

#### Secure Communication

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Use HTTPS and WSS
const socket = io('wss://api.sylith.io', {
  secure: true,
  rejectUnauthorized: true
});

// ❌ DON'T: Use unencrypted connections
const socket = io('ws://api.sylith.io'); // INSECURE
```

#### Error Handling

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Generic error messages
catch (error) {
  console.error('Trade failed:', error); // Log full error
  return { error: 'Trade execution failed' }; // Generic to user
}

// ❌ DON'T: Expose internals
catch (error) {
  return { error: error.message }; // May leak sensitive info
}
```

## 🔍 Security Features

### Implemented Protections

#### 1. Rate Limiting

```typescript
// Prevent nonce conflicts and spam
- 5 second cooldown between trades
- Queue-based execution
- Per-wallet rate limits
```

#### 2. Request Validation

```typescript
// All blockchain operations validated
- Address format checking
- Amount boundary validation
- Token existence verification
- Balance checks before execution
```

#### 3. Transaction Safety

```typescript
// Multiple safety layers
- Nonce management
- Transaction confirmation
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Failure rollback
```

#### 4. API Key Rotation

```typescript
// Multi-key support for high availability
- Automatic failover
- Key usage tracking
- Rotation without downtime
```

#### 5. Data Encryption

```typescript
// Sensitive data protection
- Environment variable storage
- Redis password authentication
- Encrypted WebSocket connections
```
